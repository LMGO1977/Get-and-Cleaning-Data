Files
CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and  transformations performed to get and clean up the data

run_analysis.R performs the data preparation folloinwg  the 5 steps required:
Merges the train and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second data set, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
AnalisysOutcome.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
